# Onboarding Site Workflow Example

This site shows how `netlify-plugin-onboarding` works. To try it out, click the Deploy to Netlify button:

[![Deploy to netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jlengstorf/onboarding-demo-site)

This will start the process of:

1. Creating your own repo with this site’s code in it
2. Prompting you for environment variables
   - **IMPORTANT:** if you want to see the onboarding flow, _do not_ fill in this variable!
3. Creating and deploying a new Netlify site

Once the site is done deploying, check out the site to see onboarding instructions. Follow the instructions and the real site will be deployed!

If you’ve ever deployed a WordPress site, this is similar to the flow WordPress follows when you create a new WordPress site and open it for the first time.
